# image_recognition
Acknowledgement: This project is based on the one created by Dan Klein and John DeNero that
was given as part of the programming assignments of Berkeley's CS188 course.
In this project, we designed two classifiers: a Naive Bayes classifier and a Perceptron classifier.
Using these classifiers, we will mainly perform two tasks: optical character recognition(OCR) and face
detection. There are two data sets: a set of scanned handwritten digit images and a set of face images
in which edges have already been detected. We will design and extract features from the given image
files using for both classifiers. We will start with 10% of the data points for training, and increase the
training set by 10% each time until we can use 100% of the data points for training and use a fixed
number of 100 samples for testing. After we finish implementing these two classifiers, we will compare
their performances and discuss the results.
